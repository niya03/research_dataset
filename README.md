## Overview
This dataset was developed as part of a research study focusing on the **early prediction of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM)** among individuals in the **United Arab Emirates (UAE)** using machine learning models.  
Since publicly available datasets do not reflect UAE-specific population trends, this dataset was **synthetically tailored** to represent the region’s demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics while maintaining realistic feature relationships.

## Original Dataset Source
The dataset structure and baseline features were adapted from the publicly available Kaggle dataset:  
**[Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset)**  

The variables in this version were modified and expanded using UAE-relevant epidemiological data and regional studies to better reflect local health patterns.
